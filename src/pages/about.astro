            Passionate problem solver who loves building end-to-end real-world solutions. Comfortable working with
            any technology or tool required to solve a problem. Built and shipped CPCRM v0.1 as a solo founding
            engineer, taking it from idea to 25 active power users. Highly active on GitHub, constantly learning,
            experimenting, and shipping new projects. Fast learner, hardworking, and adaptable. Actively looking
            for immediate opportunities where I can contribute, grow and build impactful products.

          <p>
            I hold a <strong>Diploma in Mechanical Engineering from Government Polytechnic Pune</strong>, which provided me with a strong problem-solving and analytical foundation. Building on this, I have completed a <strong>Diploma in Programming and Data Science with AI from IIT Madras</strong>, equipping me with a robust understanding of software development, data analysis, and artificial intelligence.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            In addition, I have cleared <strong>CMT Level 1</strong> and earned <strong>NISM certifications</strong>, which reflect my commitment to continuous learning and professional development beyond the tech domain.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Over the years, I have gained a broad understanding of <strong>nearly all major tech stacks</strong>, and I am confident working across different technologies to build end-to-end solutions. Whether it's web, mobile, backend, cloud, or data-driven applications, I enjoy diving deep and delivering results that matter.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I believe in creating work that not only solves problems but also inspires innovation. This portfolio reflects my journey, my projects, and my ongoing exploration in the tech world.
